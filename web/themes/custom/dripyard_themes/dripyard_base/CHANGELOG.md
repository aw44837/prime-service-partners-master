## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-16
  - The theme no longer adds `primary-color-is-dark`, `primary-color-is-light`, `secondary-color-is-dark`, or `secondary-color-is-light` CSS classes. The theme now uses CSS to calculate the color with the most contrast as needed.
  - Created templates `node--accordion-item.html.twig`, `node--testimonial.html.twig`,`node--card-full-image.html.twig`, `node--icon-card.html.twig`, and `node--card.html.twig` to create generic mapping from nodes to common SDCs. Note that templates for card and teaser already exist.
  - `card` and `card-full-image` components can now accept strings for images.
  - The `description` prop within `event-listing-item` now allows formatted text in Canvas.
  - Minor stylistic changes to menus in footer.
    - Menu links are now underlined (for accessibility reasons)
    - Third level menus no longer have left border.
    - Minor adjustments to third level menu margins.
  - Tags component title now outputs `<div>` instead of `<h3>`
  - 'null' is now an allowable type of the `width` prop within `image-or-media` component.
  - Changed carousel component's `slides_per_view` and `rows` props to be `integer` instead of `number`.
  - Added `additional_classes` prop to `button` SDC.

##  [1.1.0] - 2026-01-19
 - Removed spacing below content region only if not Canvas or landing page.
 - Added `--layout-dynamic-border-radius` CSS variable to Dynamic Layout component.
 - New component: `background-image` enables user to add a background image in a dynamic layout.
 - Added optional `text_max_width` prop to `text` component to restrict maximum width.
 - Added optional `text_max_width` prop to `heading` component to restrict maximum width.
 - Added CSS ruleset that affects nested spans and divs within Core's views responsive grid to allow cards and images to go full height.
 - New props added to `icon` component: `color`, `link_href`, `link_text`, and `open_new_window`. All new props are optional.
 - The `href` prop is no longer required within the `button` component. If omitted, it will now render a `<button>` element.
 - Drupal's default form submission button will now render a `<button>` element. Previously it rendered `<input type="submit">`.
 - Added `loading` attribute to `background-image` component to control loading attribute
 - Added `position_x` and `position_y` props to `background-image` to control which part of the image remains visible when cropped.
 - `icon-card` component now accepts rich text in Canvas. Note that it still filters out `<a>` tags because the whole card is hyperlinked.
 - New `section` layout component is a basic section (with padding, margin, and theme props), but with only one column.
 - New `grid-wrapper` layout component creates a 12 column grid, with props for gutter options.
 - New `grid-cell` layout component is meant to be nested directly within `grid-wrapper`. It has props to allow you to choose how many columns/rows it spans, alignment options, theme, and more.
 - New `inherit` option on the `color` prop of the `text` component. This new option is now the default.
 - The `promo` component is now deprecated. You can duplicate the layout with `text`, `heading`, `flex-wrapper`, and `button` components. Allowing the the visual component to be assembled allows much greater flexibility.
 - Added new `webform.progress.tracker` library to extend webform progress tracker to use color system.
 - Added new `autoplay` prop to the `carousel` component. This is disabled by default, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, and includes a play/pause button when enabled.
 - Fixed bug in `carousel` where the Canvas editor was not displaying the proper column count when in "Canvas Edit Mode".
 - Removed `theme` prop from `tab-group` component. Parent section's theme prop should be used instead.
 - Removed `theme` prop from `accordion-group` component. Parent section's theme prop should be used instead.
 - Deprecated `layout-dynamic`. Use the new `section`, `grid-wrapper`, and `grid-cell` components to reproduce the behavior in a more user friendly and flexible way.
 - New `icon-list` and `icon-list-item` components that are meant to be used together.
 - Added new `button` style variants: `secondary`, `light`, `dark` `outline`, `bare`, and `danger` for expanded design options.
 - New `aspect_ratio` prop for `canvas-image` component.
 - Added new `horizontal-line` component.
 - Added new `content-card` component.
 - Document media types are now styled. The style includes file type icons indicating their type.
